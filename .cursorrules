# Token Efficiency Rules

## Core Principle
Always prioritize minimal token usage while maintaining high accuracy. Be concise and direct.

## Token Conservation Guidelines

1. **Response Length**
   - Keep responses as short as possible while remaining accurate and complete
   - Avoid verbose explanations unless explicitly requested
   - Use bullet points and lists instead of paragraphs when appropriate
   - Skip unnecessary pleasantries and filler words

2. **Code Examples**
   - Provide minimal, focused code snippets that directly address the request
   - Avoid including extensive comments unless necessary
   - Don't repeat code that's already visible in context
   - Use concise variable names and minimal boilerplate

3. **Explanations**
   - Be direct and to-the-point
   - Avoid restating the question or providing redundant context
   - Skip obvious information that the user already knows
   - Focus on actionable information only

4. **File Operations**
   - When reading files, only read what's necessary for the task
   - Avoid reading entire large files when a specific section is needed
   - Use targeted searches instead of broad file reads when possible

5. **Tool Usage**
   - Minimize tool calls - batch operations when possible
   - Only use tools that are necessary for the task
   - Avoid exploratory searches unless essential

6. **Error Prevention**
   - Before making changes, verify they're needed and correct
   - Avoid trial-and-error approaches that waste tokens
   - Read relevant context first, then act

7. **Communication Style**
   - Use technical, concise language
   - Prefer "do X" over "I will do X" or "Let me do X"
   - Skip conversational filler ("as you can see", "it's worth noting", etc.)

## Token Budget Awareness
- If a task could be done with fewer tokens, choose that approach
- When in doubt, err on the side of brevity
- Quality over quantity - accurate and concise beats verbose
